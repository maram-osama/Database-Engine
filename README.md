# Database-Engine
Built a database engine that supports CRUD operations and Octree Indices. Upon creating a new table, corresponding files for the table are created and can handle insertion, update and deletion of table data. Table data is sorted according to the primary key which could be of String, Integer, Date or Double datatype.

An index of type Octree can be created, and it has been integrated into the system to make the update, delete and insert operations more efficient.
